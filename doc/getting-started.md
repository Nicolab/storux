# Getting started

In general, this documentation assumes that youâ€™re reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the topic in a later chapter.

To take full advantage of the documentation and learn quickly Storux, it is recommended to test the examples as and when. Do not be a mere spectator!

## Install

With NPM:

```sh
npm install storux --save
```

or with Yarn:

```sh
yarn add storux
```

## Usage

Storux supports _ESM_ (ES Module / `import`), _CJS_ (CommonJS / `require`) and _UMD_ (Universal Module Definition).
So Storux can be imported from _ESM_ and _CJS_, ...

### Create the Storux instance

The `Storux` instance is like a container of stores.

```js
import {Storux} from 'storux';
// or const {Storux} = require('storux');

const storux = new Storux();

export default storux;
```

All the stores created with `storux` are accessible with `storux.stores`.

Example:

```js
import {Store} from 'storux';
// or const {Store} = require('storux');

class AppStore extends Store {}
class AuthStore extends Store {}
class BlogStore extends Store {}

const appStore = storux.create(AppStore);
const authStore = storux.create(AuthStore);
const blogStore = storux.create(BlogStore);

console.log(storux.stores);

appStore.setState({name: 'My awesome Web App'});

console.log('from Storux instance:', storux.stores.appStore.getState());
console.log('from AppStore instance:', appStore.getState());
```

Thanks to the instance of Storux, you can listen to the events of all stores.

> We will discuss it later in the documentation, in the chapter [lifecycle](lifecycle.md).

## Summary

At this point, you've successfully installed Storux, created the `storux` instance with your first stores.
Congratulations!

Further we will see the methods and patterns to interact with the state.

The [next chapter explores the core concepts](core-concepts.md), an essential chapter to understand Storux.
