# Storux

Storux is a state store manager, to manage the state of an application (Website, App mobile, Web App, <abbr title="Server Side Rendering">SSR</abbr>, ...).

You can manage the entire state of your project with a single store or separate the state into many specific stores (authStore, articleStore, commentStore, appStore, ...).

Storux supports _ESM_ (ES Module / `import`), _CJS_ (CommonJS / `require`) and _UMD_ (Universal Module Definition).
