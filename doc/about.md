# About

> ℹ️ TODO: This documentation is in progress.

Storux has been used in several projects for several years (with React.js, Marko.js, Vanilla JS, ...).

Storux is the result of the evolution and refinement of the front-end application development needs for several years.

Hoping that Storux improves your front-end (and SSR) developer life, as it improves ours.
